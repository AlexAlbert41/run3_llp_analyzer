    "#### Comparison of Clusters in Data vs MC. This is to validate the signal reconstruction process. We compare cluster from Z->MuMu events in Data vs those from a DY->ZMuMu (50-120 GeV for MLL). Data is from 2023D, and MC is from the postBPix, normalized to the appropriate value with an initial DBSCAN skim applied"
